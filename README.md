# Qt-gradecalculator
Goal of this project is to create a grade calculator
which calcluates accumulate grades for Pic 10A and 10B classes.
There are two schemes for calculating the grades:
The final score will be based on scores of homework, midterm 1 and midterm 2 and Final Exam
scheme one: 
final score = 25% homework + 20% midterm1 + 20% midterm 2 + 35% final
scheme two:
final score = 25% homework + 30% Highest Midterm + 44% Final Exam
The highest score of these two will be chosen
In the program, the user can first check the scheme they want to use and them drag the bars
the final score will be automatically calculated at the lower right corner.
NOTICE: The final will be zeor if you don't check the scheme box.
